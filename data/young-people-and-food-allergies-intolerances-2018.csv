It?s infuriating. Stating whether there is the allergen on the premises and whether the same utensils have been used on them as as well as my food is enough for me to be satisfied. It is then up to us sufferers to decide to eat it or not as we appreciate there cannot be a 100% guarantee unless the ingredients were prepared in the factory in a say, nut free zone but simply and only telling customers, ?We can?t guarantee it?, is not helpful and it is unnecessary. They could be more informative with all the knowledge they know of the preparation happening under their roof. It will result in more business for them so it?s in their interest to be more helpful whilst still covering themselves. Happy for them to say they can?t guarantee but support that with all the info they do know about the food prep on their premises. Thank you for this survey. Hopefully we can make a difference.","London","#N/A","#N/A","#N/A","#N/A","#N/A","#N/A","#N/A","#N/A","Employed full-time","#N/A","Yes"

In my case of Coeliac Disease, I can't eat gluten, which is not just 'wheat' as many people think. It's Barley and Rye and cross contamination is not ok. From my experience, I just don't think a lot of staff and business owners really understand the serious effect a reaction has on me. They aren't aware or educated enough on allergens or reactions. And I feel some people may look at Coeliac Disease as a 'fad diet' especially since I'm a young 20 year old. I find eating out extremely uncomfortable when I have to ask for detailed allergens and preparation methods, I get embarrassed. I know I shouldn't but I do! I don't really know why the UK is this way. I'm fortunate to have travelled a lot and Australia has an amazing awareness of Gluten Free foods. The staff and management know about Coeliac Disease and a lot of places will advertise 'gluten free' then also state 'not suitable for Coeliacs' which although frustrating, is incredibly helpful to me as I can avoid reactions to cross contamination. Or staff will ask me if I need it prepared separately or on clean equipment- and I really really appreciate that! I get incredibly anxious when eating out in this country. Even going for a drink. For example, I went to Starbucks today after checking their nutritional information online. I opted for an iced tea, probably the safest thing on the menu! Yet when I was drinking it, I noticed crumbs, actual crumbs in the bottom of the cup. My stomach dropped, as I'm already recovering from a reaction, to have that happen instantly put me on edge. Anyway, I asked my boyfriend to ask the staff about what they were, as I get very anxious about being 'fussy' or 'rude', he's a saint. They were confirmed to be digestive crumbs from their new Cheesecake Frappucino range. Apparently they are decanted in to a plastic cup and when they run out, that cup is still used! I tried my hardest to even stay away from the blenders where cross contamination would be possible and I still managed to run in to difficulty! I don't want to have to announce to everyone I have a disease when I enter an eating establishment. It's very uncomfortable and it shouldn't always be necessary. There is A HUGE amount of room for improvement when eating out or ordering take away. I would even like to be involved in such things as I feel very strongly about it. I couldn't imagine the struggle for people with more intolerances/allergies. I work in a bar and also at a high street coffee shop chain and I always follow strict allergen procedures as I am familiar with the struggle as a customer. However, I know a lot of staff don't follow strict procedures because they simply don't understand the consequences and there is a huge lack of training. If you would like any more feedback, ideas or assistance I would be very happy to help. I hope this isn't against any guidelines but my email is izz.stirk@gmail.com.","West Midlands","#N/A","#N/A","#N/A","#N/A","#N/A","#N/A","#N/A","#N/A","Employed full-time","#N/A","Yes"

I understand if particular things are too risky they can point this out but saying the whole menu can?t be guaranteed is ridiculous. No restaurant would dream of telling customers they cant guarantee there isn?t cross contamination with raw meat for example, so there should be no risk of allergen cross contamination.   All staff should be educated a bit more on allergens, the dangers and the options for people who need to avoid them. They should be taught how to talk to customers with allergies/intolerances as more often than not you?re made to feel like an inconvenience. I think in the same way food staff are required to do a health and safety course, an allergens course would be a huge benefit.","Scotland","#N/A","#N/A","#N/A","#N/A","#N/A","#N/A","#N/A","#N/A","Employed full-time","#N/A","Yes"

For example, with coeliac disease, staff think it is okay to just remove the item from the plate therefore having no knowledge of cross contamination.   Also, most restaurants have disclaimers stating that they cannot guarantee cross contamination within their kitchen. This makes it almost impossible to eat out or order takeaway due to lack of confidence.  This impacts on young adult?s social life whilst at school and university due to severe lack of understanding and food options available whilst not having the family support at meal times. Often they will not eat if eating out to avoid risk of becoming ill and will almost certainly take a packed lunch.  A separate menu would address this issue.  It is very socially isolating to have to always ask for allergens as it appears as if you are being fussy.  Sadly, it is not a choice to be coeliac.","Scotland","#N/A","#N/A","#N/A","#N/A","#N/A","#N/A","#N/A","#N/A","Full time student/at school","#N/A","No"

Often restaurants and takeaways cater more diligently to people with lifestyle choices e.g. vegan and gluten intolerant (ie using separate utensils) when the cross contamination risk won?t actually physically harm these people, unless of course someone has a gluten allergy. It?s frustrating how ?trendy? eating styles are catered too but often the severity of allergies is underplayed. Restaurants and takeaway should have to cater for people with allergies and should be able to state ?but traces may be found in our food? as a legal excuse to get out of liability for not taking sufficient steps to minimise risk. This makes risk much more difficult I navigate as some restaurants say it and think that?s it for legal cover and don?t try to cater safely. While others have it on the menu for legal reasons but their checks are really good.

A basic understanding from staff or readily available allergens book for the menu that could just be grabbed that is reliable is ideal. Staff tell me I can have things when I quite clearly can?t, I usually try to test staff to make sure they understand. I was told I could eat everything on the menu and nothing contained milk so I asked if I could have a white tea and they said yes. I asked if it was soya and they said yes. I asked if I could have a milkshake and they said yes. Ice cream? Yes. A glass of milk? Yes.

Some places make me feel like they don?t understand my allergy at all and offer me food items that clearly have gluten in. I am very wary of any sauces or condiments. It is difficult trusting someone else with your food allergy and even harder telling someone you have the condition as it can make someone feel very isolated and separate. Having allergy menus on the table or even allergy advice on normal menus would be extremely useful and make many people feel less different. I rarely eat out though as personally I find it very difficult to trust someone else and most places make me feel very un-easy about the food I?m about to consume. Staff should be more reassuring and maybe just provide basic foods that don?t have certain allergens. It?s easy to make sauces with corn flour instead of wheat and simple changes like that would make it so much easier to go out. I rarely tell those I am with about my allergy (as I don?t suffer immediate side effects) and I don?t want to make a deal of it but I want to be able to trust those I am eating food from.","East Midlands","#N/A","#N/A","#N/A","#N/A","#N/A","#N/A","#N/A","#N/A","Full time student/at school","#N/A","Yes"

I am intolerant to cow's milk and wheat. Allergen menus often tell you whether the dish has those things in It, but doesn't specify which part of the meal contains it. For example, mashed potato might contain milk, but the rest of the dish doesn't contain any. If i knew which part of the dish contained the Allergen, that item could be swapped out for something else. I often find that I can't eat anything in restaurants because the allergen menu says everything contains one if the allergens. I often quiz restaurant staff abput the different elements of dishes - this is so time consuming and results in the staff running to and from the kitchen and annoying the chefs.","South West","#N/A","#N/A","#N/A","#N/A","#N/A","#N/A","#N/A","#N/A","Employed full-time","#N/A","Yes"

Similar logic to the Spare Pens in Schools. It would ease anxiety massively to know the restaurant care about the safety of allergy sufferers.","Cross contamination can be awful as restaurant staff are often woefully underprepared and unknowledgeable when it comes to allergen transparency (as evidenced by the journalistic investigations of BBC's Rip Off Britain which found 10/30 restaurants didn't know what allergens were in the food they were serving. Small practices such as using the same spoon for almond pesto and bolognese in the local deli I eat my lunch at - even when I informed the serving staff that I had a nut allergy, they were not aware that the practice of using the same spoon could have severe consequences. Likewise, coffee shops serving almond milk will often use the same milk frothing jug for normal milk. I feel, unless they have an allergy themselves, they can be rather careless, and not as conscientious as they should be.     Likewise, I would personally like to see the extension of the Human Medicines Regulation, amended for schools in 2017, to the catering industry. I firmly believe restaurants should have the option to purchase and store spare Epipens in the case of an emergency. The EU FIC regulation of 2014 clearly hasn't resulted in the level of transparency and care which was intended. Even if restaurants are willing to comply with this legislation and work to act preventatively, a mistake on their part can have fatal consequences, and the availability of spare Epipens could be live-saving.","North West","#N/A","#N/A","#N/A","#N/A","#N/A","#N/A","#N/A","#N/A","Full time student/at school","#N/A","Yes"

Having a full ingredients list wouldn?t stop this risk but would reduce it greatly.
